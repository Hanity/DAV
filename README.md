# Data Analysis and Visulalization: Weather Prediction
Four level are analysedd.
1.Descriptive Amalysis
2.Inferential  Analysis
3.Machine Learning Analysis
4.Deep Learning Analysis

The file is too large to be places in this repository

This report used both Micro and macro methology and the four level mentioned above .

##Level One: Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive analysis on both the population data and sample
Population data = the entire dataset (UI Lab, Argyle and Langley locations in chicago)
sample data : Two location (UI lab and Argyle) 

This analysis will answer objective EQ1.

therefore DAV DEscriptive analysis perform the aforementioned objective
P.S The data for UI and ARGYle is split from the population and saved to smartH therefore dont forget to remove the commanda in comment in orderr to download.


You can access the machine learning codes from DAV DAV_Descriptive_Analysis_and_Inferential_(Inferential_for_population_data_and_sample_data).ipynp

## Level Two : Inferential statistics
This answers objective EQ2

1. Paired T-Test
2. Correlation
3. ANova Test
4. Chi-test

All of this testing methods are explained well in DAV INferential.ipynp file

For this python code use final.xlsx


You can access the machine learning codes from DAV Inferential Statistics.ipnpy

## Level Four: MAchine Learning : Model a weather prediction Model

This answers EQ3

### Regression models
Predict temperature from temperature input
1.Linear regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3.CART Regression
4.Random Forest Regression

#### For Rainfall Predcition using only one input variable(Relative humidity)
1. Polynomial Regression


#### For Rainfall Predcition using only one Two input variable(Temperature and Relative Humidity)
1. Multivariate Polynomial Regression

You can access the machine learning codes from DAV Machine Learning.ipynp

# Level Four :Deep Learning for prediciting temperature and rainfall
In this section the data is trained by changing the hidden layer number as well as the itteration in order to deeply train the data to create a good prediction system

1. LSTM Model : Temperatiure prediction using 20 percent of its data as training data
2. Regression Based Deep Learning : RAinfall Prediction using (Temperature and Relative Humidity as input)

DAV Deep Learning.ipnpy and forDeep Learning.ipnpy containg various models.
